Acoustic Scene Classification via Feature Disentanglement

This repository contains the official implementation of the methods presented in the paper:
"Acoustic Scene Classification Across Cities and Devices via Feature Disentanglement"

Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) aims to classify audio recordings into predefined environment categories. This project addresses the challenge of ASC under domain shifts, particularly across different cities and recording devices, by leveraging feature disentanglement techniques to enhance model generalization.
