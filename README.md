Acoustic Scene Classification via Feature Disentanglement

This repository contains the official implementation of the methods presented in the paper:
"Acoustic Scene Classification Across Cities and Devices via Feature Disentanglement" (published on TASLP)

Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) aims to classify audio recordings into predefined environment categories. This project addresses the challenge of ASC under domain shifts, particularly across different cities and recording devices, by leveraging feature disentanglement techniques to enhance model generalization.

*JSON Configuration for Dataset Splitting*

The json folder contains JSON files that define dataset splits. These files specify how the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring consistency in experiments. Modify these JSON files if you need custom splits.
